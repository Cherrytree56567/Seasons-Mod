# Winter Seasons Mod
A simple `Fabric` `1.19.4` mod that adds snow during winter and adds fog during the night and morning.

# Features
 - Fog
 - Weather Timer
 - Snow Particles
 - Frost Bite
 - Fire Warming

# Testing
To test, set the time to 504000 ticks to enable winter. If you want to see the fog disappeaar, set the time to 0 ticks and then run `/fog stop`.

# Running
To run, use `./gradlew.bat runClient` for Windows and `./gradlew runClient` for Linux. It will launch a Minecraft window. From there, you can create a new world and test the mod.

# Seasons Mod
A simple `Fabric` `1.21.11` mod that adds snow during winter and adds fog during the night and morning.
![Demo](https://github.com/Cherrytree56567/Seasons-Mod/blob/master/Demoes/2.1.png?raw=true)

# Features
 - Fog
 - Weather Timer
 - Snow Particles
 - Frost Bite
 - Fire Warming
 - Leaves Color Change in Autumn

# Testing
To test, set the time to 504000 ticks to enable winter. Each season runs for `168000` ticks. Autumn leaves will only turn brown in newly generated chunks.

# Running
To run, use `./gradlew.bat runClient` for Windows and `./gradlew runClient` for Linux. It will launch a Minecraft window. From there, you can create a new world and test the mod.
